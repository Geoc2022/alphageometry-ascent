# Problem: pset4_1

In the accompanying diagram of circle O, AD is a diameter with AD parallel
to chord BC, chords AB and CD are drawn, and chords BD and AC intersect at E.
Prove: BE = CE

## Notes

We could use `Perp` to represent the fact that AD is a diameter
but this is only implicit from the problem. This also makes the
`Cyclic` useless in the problem. However, this is true in general
since A, B, C, D are on the circle the angle A B D is equal to the
angle D C A.
